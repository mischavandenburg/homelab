# This ConfigMap is just a way to define the cloudflared config.yaml file in k8s.
# It's useful to define it in k8s, rather than as a stand-alone .yaml file, because
# this lets you use various k8s templating solutions (e.g. Helm charts) to
# parameterize your config, instead of just using string literals.

    # Remember, these rules route traffic from cloudflared to a local service. To route traffic
    # from the internet to cloudflared, run `cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel> <hostname>`.
    # E.g. `cloudflared tunnel route dns example-tunnel tunnel.example.com`.

    # This rule sends traffic to the built-in hello-world HTTP server. This can help debug connectivity
    # issues. If hello.example.com resolves and tunnel.example.com does not, then the problem is
    # in the connection from cloudflared to your local service, not from the internet to cloudflared.
